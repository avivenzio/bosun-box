# Hardware

This directory will house any code needed for rpi GPIO or arduino. As well as any server code to supplement signalk.

### Potential uses
- Map buttons to keyboard input for navigation
- Read input from outboard analog wiring harness
  - Outboard > Pi GPIO 
  - Outboard > arduino > Pi GPIO
- Server to expose data from outboard wiring harness
- Can we read the analog data from signalk and send as a part of the protocol
